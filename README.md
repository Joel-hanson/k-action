```


### Getting Started :airplane:

You can include the action in your workflow to trigger on any event that [GitHub actions supports](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows). If the remote branch that you wish to deploy to doesn't already exist the action will create it for you. Your workflow will also need to include the `actions/checkout` step before this workflow runs in order for the deployment to work.


If you'd like to make it so the workflow only triggers on push events to specific branches then you can modify the `on` section.

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
```

### Configuration üìÅ

The `with` portion of the workflow **must** be configured before the action will work. You can add these in the `with` section found in the examples above. Any `secrets` must be referenced using the bracket syntax and stored in the GitHub repositories `Settings/Secrets` menu. You can learn more about setting environment variables with GitHub actions [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsenv).

#### Required Setup

One of the following deployment options must be configured.

### Artifacts üìÅ

You can get the outputs as artifacts, for example the output accuracy and the models can be saved. Hence can get this output from the workflow artifacts. [learn more about artifacts](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts).

The following is example of how to download the artifacts.

```yaml
name: Push notebook to kaggle

on: push

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ ubuntu-latest, macos-latest ]
        os: [ ubuntu-latest ]
        python-version: [ '2.7.17', '3.6.10' ]
    name: Python ${{ matrix.python-version }} ${{ matrix.os }}

    - name: Kaggle deploy as new
      uses: joelhanson/kaggle-kernel-actions
      with:
        kaggle_username: ${{ secrets.kaggle_username }}
        kaggle_key: ${{ secrets.kaggle_key }}
        kaggle_make_new_kernel: true
        kernel_id: <username>/<kernel_slug>
        code_file_path: <folder>/<file_path_to.ipynb>
        kernel_title: <kernel_title>
        language: python
        kernel_type: notebook
        is_private: true
        enable_gpu: false
        enable_internet: false
        competition: titanic
        submit_to_competition: false
        collect_output: true

    - name: Download outputs
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
      with:
        name: outputs
        path: outputs/outputs.zip
```

---

### Submit kernels (In progress)

You can submit kernels by adding the following inputs for the jobs

```yml
    - name: Kaggle deploy from existing metadata file
      uses: ./
      with:
        kaggle_username: ${{ secrets.kaggle_username }}
        kaggle_key: ${{ secrets.kaggle_key }}
        kaggle_make_new_kernel: true
        kaggle_metadata_path: test/kernel-metadata.json
        kernel_id: joelhanson/github-action-test
        competition: titanic
        submit_to_competition: true  # This needs to be true
```

### FAQ

1. Where to find the kernel_id?

You can find the kernel_id by going to the top menu of the kernel and clicking `copy api command`.
