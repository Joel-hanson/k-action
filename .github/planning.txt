# The step user follow:
# - There is case where the user is coming as a newbee
# - The newbee will create a python file or jupter file and then he tries to push his code

# - There will be person who will push the existing code
# - The existing code person should provide the meta and the login details.
# - He uploads his kernel and pushes the code

# - Check for the linting
# - So when he tries push we should check for the keys and the username, and we should show message for the event which is happening
# - The checks will be weather the username and password are correct
# - Is the push details provided as file or the args
# - Make a PR to make the meta file. $(this needs to be reconsidered)
# - Make a shedule to check action for the getting the current state
# - show success message
# - Save the output and the results from kaggle
# - Make a PR for saving the output file

# The things to collect:
# - They should enter the username and the key
# - They should make files or upload files
# - They should create the metadata file or update the metadata by args
# - Check if a version is running right now for the kernel
# - Submit the code while merging it to a new branch

# consider not needed but can do
# - The custom badge
# - The website to store all the results accuracy

TODO: The output file checking should be with custom timeperiod
